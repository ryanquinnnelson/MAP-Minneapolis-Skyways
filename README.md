# A Better Map of the Minneapolis Skyways

Summer 2019 mapping project to build a more accurate map of the Minneapolis skyway system

## Project Summary
The Minneapolis Skyway system consists of a series of climate-controlled pedestrian walkways which connect the second floors of a large number of buildings in Minneapolis' downtown district. Developed over time, often by retrofitting buildings, the network is vast and organic. According to the city, with the 2016 extension to the U.S. Bank Stadium, the skyways include 8 cumulative miles of pathways.

As an urbanist, I'm fascinated by the skyways. I lived downtown for two years between 2018 and 2020 and used the skyways daily for commuting to work. In my opinion, the skyways exemplify a unique example of a "C-Grid" urban design pattern. Coined by urbanist Douglas Duany, a C-Grid is a pedestrian network that crosses the A-Grid (major) and B-Grid (minor) street patterns navigated by vehicles. Typically a C-Grid is found on the same level as vehicular traffic. In Minneapolis, it is raised above the ground, freeing pedestrians from the brutal winter weather and the need to compete with heavy downtown traffic while crossing streets. Additionally, because the skyway connects organically through the middles of buildings, it is generally faster to take the skyway to get around than to walk the sidewalk grid below.

I couldn't find a detailed map of the skyways, so I decided to build my own version. For each floor plan that I found online, I created a CAD version. Then I stitched the various pieces together as best I could and illustrated the result in Photoshop. To avoid any security issues, I set myself a rule that I could only include floor plans that I discovered to be in the public domain.

## Next Steps
- Add new buildings to the map
- Modify the color scheme to be more visually appealing.
